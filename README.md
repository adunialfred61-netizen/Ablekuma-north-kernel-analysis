## 📘 Overview

This project investigates the **spatial distribution and safety preparedness of educational facilities** in Ablekuma, a fast-growing community in the **Greater Accra Region of Ghana**.  

Using **field-collected GPS data** and **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** in GIS, the project visualizes the **density, accessibility, and spatial patterns** of schools while assessing their **fire and safety readiness**.  

The study serves as a geospatial reference for **urban planners, local authorities, and researchers** focusing on spatial equity, infrastructure safety, and community development.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Map the **locations and ownership types** of educational, health, fuel, and mechanical facilities in Ablekuma.  
- Assess the **safety preparedness** of these facilities (fire extinguishers, first aid kits, alarms, signage).  
- Perform **Kernel Density Analysis** to identify clusters of educational institutions.  
- Generate a **GIS database and visualization maps** for municipal use and research reference.

---

## 🧭 Methodology

### **Data Collection**
- Field data were collected using **Survey123 for ArcGIS**, capturing:
  - GPS coordinates  
  - Facility type  
  - Ownership (Public or Private)  
  - Years in operation and working hours  
  - Safety measures available  
- Data were exported from **ArcGIS Online** to **Excel (CSV format)**.

### **Spatial Analysis**
- Data imported into **QGIS and ArcGIS** for visualization.  
- Applied **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** on educational facility points to analyze:
  - Spatial concentration  
  - Service coverage  
  - Accessibility gaps  
- Classified output into **high**, **medium**, and **low-density zones**.

## 🧩 Findings

- **Total Facilities Surveyed:**  
  - Educational Institutions: 28  
  - Health Facilities: 19  
  - Mechanic Workshops: 14  
  - Filling Stations: 3  

- **Ownership:**  
  - Private: 80%  
  - Public: 20%  

- **Safety Preparedness:**  
  - Filling stations had the highest compliance.  
  - Most **schools and workshops lacked fire extinguishers or alarms**.  
  - Private schools were slightly more equipped than public ones.

- **Kernel Density Results:**  
  - High concentration of schools in central Ablekuma.  
  - Peripheral zones showed **low facility density**, indicating **underserved areas**.

---

## 💡 Insights

- Educational facilities are **unevenly distributed**, with service clusters forming around the core urban area.  
- Lack of basic safety equipment poses a **significant fire risk** in schools and workshops.  
- Kernel density visualization supports **data-driven policy decisions** for safer infrastructure planning.
